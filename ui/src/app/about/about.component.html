<h1>About Benjamin Franklin's Thirteen Virtues</h1>

<ul>
  <li>Temperance. Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.</li>
  <li>Silence. Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.</li>
  <li>Order. Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.</li>
  <li>Resolution. Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.</li>
  <li>Frugality. Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.</li>
  <li>Industry. Lose no time; be always employ'd in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.</li>
  <li>Sincerity. Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.</li>
  <li>Justice. Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.</li>
  <li>Moderation. Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.</li>
  <li>Cleanliness. Tolerate no uncleanliness in body, cloaths, or habitation.</li>
  <li>Tranquillity. Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.</li>
  <li>Chastity. Rarely use venery but for health or offspring, never to dullness, weakness, or the injury of your own or another's peace or reputation.</li>
  <li>Humility. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.</li>
</ul>
